# SEH_Test_Solution

The inputs of title and body are required for the program to work properly. Once input use "get Images" button to retrieve first six images from google image search.

The images can be selected in the lower half of the window and then added to a slide along with the title and body using the "Create Slide" button.
Note: Every time you press "Create Slide" button a new slide will be created.

Finally, use the "Create Presentation" button to finalize the presentation and save it as "Output.pptx".



Future Work:
  -Allow user to select save location
  -Allow user to copy images to clipboard
  -Allow for going through multiple pages of images
